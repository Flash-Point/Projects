-Automated KKBT Miner-
Some collegues of mine signed up on a mining platform where they needed to manually 
login everyday to start the mine. I offered to create a script for them to automate this process.
The site has since been taken down. Code is in the Program.cs file. I have removed sensitive data 
and replaced with dummy data.
